    <h3>What's this all about?</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Tony. I used to own a coffee house 
    but have found it more financially responsible to give away free drinks
    and do software engineering for money.</p>
<p>As the pandemic initially seemed like it was winding down I realized I
    wanted some way to start to build a bit of community in my building and area.
    With my previous barista experience, I figured, what better way than to 
    open up for people to swing by, have coffee, and strike up some conversations.
